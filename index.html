          That you found a girl and you're married now.

          Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made.

        Verse 1:
I heard that you're settled down,
That you found a girl and you're married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.

Chorus:
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said,
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead."

Verse 2:
Nothing compares, no worries or cares,
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made.
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Chorus:
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said,
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead."
